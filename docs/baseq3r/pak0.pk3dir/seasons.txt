Description: Winternacht & Sommergewitter are little FFA styled maps for 2-5 players. 
They are my first ever released maps, and are no attempt to create seriously competion or tourney maps,
but to create some of the most beautiful and atmospheric maps for Quake 3 using all the goodness of Q3map2.



     [] System requirements []
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Because of the lots of details and eycandy seen in the maps the r_speeds are extremely rough, 
although the maps are already optimised for speed.
You can gain speed with lowering the texture detail and setting r_subdivisions to 8 or 16.
A graphics card with 64mb of ram should be at least the minimum to play it.



     [] How to play []
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For Quake 3:    Copy the .pk3 file into your baseq3 directory
For Open Arena: Copy the .pk3 file into your baseoa directory
For War§ow:     Copy the .pk3 file into your basewsw directory
For WoP:        Copy the .pk3 file into your wop directory
and you are ready to rock!

Type "\map winter" or "\map summer" into the console or choose the map through the skirmish menu.
